We looked at the effect of warm waters cyclically upwelling on to the continental shelf under Totten Glacier, East Antarctica and its potential to unground pinning points, which may lead to significant grounding line retreat. We found that these cycles could be the cause of ripples on the surface of the ice shelf, which are also present on other glaciers in Antarctica. 

### Northern Patagonian Icefield
We used a 2-D mass conservation method in combination with an optimisation algorithm to find the ice thickness of the Northern Patagonian Icefield. This is then used to investigate the piedmont lobe collapse of San Quintin Glacier. This is done by growing the glacier up to it's terminal moraine and then causing it to calve. We find that some of the current observable thinning at the glacier front maybe due to the recent collapse of the lobe.
