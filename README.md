## About

My research focuses on ice flow and snow mechanics, particularly on the role of ice dynamics in understanding mass loss from glaciers via the use of numerical modelling, working primarily with BISICLES.

## Research Interests

Glaciers, Antarctic Ice Sheet, Ice sheet modelling, Earth system modelling
